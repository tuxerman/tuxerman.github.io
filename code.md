Most of my open source code lives on [github.com/tuxerman](http://github.com/tuxerman). Currently just a collection of repositories hastily bunched together, it does have the occasional interesting block of code or two. 

There is also the snack edition at [tuxerman: gists](http://gist.github.com/tuxerman).
