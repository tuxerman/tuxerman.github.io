##### Today
I currently work as a backend Software Engineer at [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) where I solve problems and build things around understanding places, locations and [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding).

##### Once upon a time
During the summer of 2014 I interned at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com) in Atlanta, working on and around [Openstack](https://www.openstack.org/).
Grad school was preceded by a stint as Systems Software Engineer in the healthcare division of [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/entry/in/en/) in Bangalore. 
I did some fun work around electronic control of diesel engines in the summer of 2011 as an intern in the Automotive division of [Mahindra & Mahindra](http://www.mahindra.com/).
