Iâ€™m a second year graduate student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and this is a page that I hope will serve as my web presence junction of sorts.

My resume along with a quick academic and professional bio live at /bio.

I also like to call myself a fledgling storyteller of sorts. A blog, photography page and some nascent attempts at music can be found at [/dabble](#dabble).
Finally, for those inclined towards writing of the more succinct variety, check out my github page and other code at /code.
