##### Writing
I write occasionally (less frequently these days than I would care to admit) at [SeePha](http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke). This started off many years ago on [blogger](http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.com) as an arbit collection of personal posts and at the most chuckle-inducing rants but seems to have grown older and wiser over the years into a longer form comprising quite a few travelogues. Travelling has been a deeply personal and favourite pastime.

The other side to storytelling comes in the form of [photography](http://tuxerman.tumblr.com), another evolving and satisfying hobby. 

##### Music
Violin, music, flute.

##### Design, Products and Engineering
For a while, it was a case of merely having strong opinions about the above. Perhaps it was the creative itch, but I decided to do something about it by tinkering about with some good old HTML, CSS and JS (the last time I properly did any of those was in the Windows 98 era). This site is one such experiment. Moving my blogger blog to a github-pages hosted, [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based one is another.
