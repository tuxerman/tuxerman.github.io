##### Writing
I write occasionally (less frequently these days than I would care to admit) at [SeePha](http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke). This started off many years ago on [blogger](http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.com) as an arbit collection of personal posts and at the most chuckle-inducing rants but seems to have grown older and wiser over the years into a longer form comprising quite a few travelogues. Travelling has been a deeply personal and favourite pastime.

The other side to storytelling comes in the form of [photography](http://tuxerman.tumblr.com), another evolving and satisfying hobby. 

##### Music
~~**1998**: Oh, look a violin!<br/>~~
~~**2001**: I hate going to violin classes, mum. I want a keyboard. I like that thing. <br/>~~
~~**2002**: I love this keyboard. If only I had my own. <br/>~~
~~**2007**: The drums is where it's at. This is so intuitive. And the most satisfying thing to play. <br/>~~
... <br/>
~~**2014**: Oh look, a violin! I wonder if I can still play it like old. <br/>~~
~~**2015**: I love the violin. Man I know nothing about wind instruments. Also, the Irish [whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle) sounds beautiful.~~ <br/>
~~**2016**: I absolutely love the damn whistle. Oh look, the [bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri) is played with the same finger-placement!~~

Scatterbrained and occasionally on the lookout for a more expressive medium.

##### Design, Products and Engineering
For a while, it was a case of merely having strong opinions about the above. This site is one experiment where the itch was actually scratched. Moving my old blog from blogger to a [newer](http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke), github-pages hosted one is another.
