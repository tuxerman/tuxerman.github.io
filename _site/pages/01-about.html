    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Iâ€™m a second year graduate student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and this is a page that I hope will serve as my web presence junction of sorts.</p>

<p>My resume along with a quick academic and professional bio live at /bio.</p>

<p>I also like to call myself a fledgling storyteller of sorts. A blog, photography page and some nascent attempts at music can be found at <a href="#dabble">/dabble</a>.
Finally, for those inclined towards writing of the more succinct variety, check out my github page and other code at /code.</p>
