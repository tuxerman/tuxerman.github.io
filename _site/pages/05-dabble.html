    <h5 id="writing">Writing</h5>
<p>I write occasionally (less frequently these days than I would care to admit) at <a href="http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke">SeePha</a>. This started off many years ago on <a href="http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.com">blogger</a> as an arbit collection of personal posts and at the most chuckle-inducing rants but seems to have grown older and wiser over the years into a longer form comprising quite a few travelogues. Travelling has been a deeply personal and favourite pastime.</p>

<p>The other side to storytelling comes in the form of <a href="http://tuxerman.tumblr.com">photography</a>, another evolving and satisfying hobby.</p>

<h5 id="music">Music</h5>
<p><strong>1998</strong>: Oh, look a violin!<br />
<strong>2001</strong>: I hate going to violin classes, mum. I want a keyboard. I like that thing. <br />
<strong>2002</strong>: I love this keyboard. If only I had my own. <br />
<strong>2007</strong>: The drums is where it’s at. This is so intuitive. And the most satisfying thing to play. <br />
… <br />
<strong>2014</strong>: Oh look, a violin! I wonder if I can still play it like old. <br />
<strong>2015</strong>: I love the violin. Man I know nothing about wind instruments. Also, the Irish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle">whistle</a> sounds beautiful. <br />
<strong>2016</strong>: I absolutely love the damn whistle. Oh look, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri">bansuri</a> is played with the same finger-placement!</p>

<p>For a while, it was a case of merely having strong opinions about the above. This site is one experiment where the itch was actually scratched. Moving my old blog from blogger to a <a href="http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke">newer</a>, github-pages hosted one is another.</p>
