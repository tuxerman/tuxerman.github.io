    <h5 id="writing">Writing</h5>
<p>I write occasionally (less frequently these days than I would care to admit) at <a href="http://tuxerman.github.io/anotherbloggerbloke">SeePha</a>. This started off many years ago on <a href="http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.com">blogger</a> as an arbit collection of personal posts and at the most chuckle-inducing rants but seems to have grown older and wiser over the years into a longer form comprising quite a few travelogues. Travelling has been a deeply personal and favourite pastime.</p>

<p>The other side to storytelling comes in the form of <a href="http://tuxerman.tumblr.com">photography</a>, another evolving and satisfying hobby.</p>

<h5 id="music">Music</h5>
<p>Violin, music, flute.</p>

<h5 id="design-products-and-engineering">Design, Products and Engineering</h5>
<p>For a while, it was a case of merely having strong opinions about the above. Perhaps it was the creative itch, but I decided to do something about it by tinkering about with some good old HTML, CSS and JS (the last time I properly did any of those was in the Windows 98 era). This site is one such experiment. Moving my blogger blog to a github-pages hosted, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>-based one is another.</p>
