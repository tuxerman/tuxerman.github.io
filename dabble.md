I write occasionally (less frequently these days than I would care to admit) at [anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.in](http://anotherbloggerbloke.blogspot.in). This started off many years ago as an arbit collection of personal posts and at the most chuckle-inducing rants but seems to have grown older and wiser over the years into a longer form comprising quite a few travelogues. Travelling has been a deeply personal and favourite pastime.

The other side to storytelling comes in the form of photography, another evolving and satisfying hobby. You can find my work at [Whistle for level crossing](http://tuxerman.tumblr.com).
