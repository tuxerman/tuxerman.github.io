I'm a second year graduate student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and this is a page that I hope will serve as my web presence junction of sorts.

[My resume](/files/SriramP.pdf) along with a quick academic and professional bio live at [/bio](/bio).

I also like to call myself a fledgling storyteller of sorts. A blog, photography page and some nascent attempts at music can be found at [/dabble](/dabble).

Finally, for those inclined towards writing of the more succinct variety, check out my [github](http://github.com/tuxerman) page and other code at [/code](/code).
