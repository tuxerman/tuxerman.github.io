I'm a second year graduate student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech, and this is a page that I hope will serve as my web presence junction of sorts.

<strong>[My resume](/resume.pdf)</strong> along with a quick academic and professional bio live at <strong>[/bio](/bio)</strong>.

I also like to call myself a fledgling storyteller of sorts. A blog, photography page and some nascent attempts at music can be found at <strong>[/dabble](/dabble)</strong>.

Finally, for those inclined towards writing of the more succinct variety, check out my <strong>[github](http://github.com/tuxerman)</strong> page and other code at <strong>[/code](/code)</strong>.
