I'm a second year graduate student of Computer Science at Georgia Tech who is interested in Networked and Distributed Systems. 

My <strong>[resume](/resume.pdf)</strong>, academics and such biographical paraphernalia can be found at <strong>[/bio](/acad)</strong>.

I also like to call myself a storyteller of sorts. Blog, photography page and some music can be found at <strong>[/dabble](/dabble)</strong>.

Finally, for those inclined towards writing of the more succinct variety, check out my <strong>[github](http://github.com/tuxerman)</strong> page and other code at <strong>[/code](/code)</strong>.
